      <h1>Restoring Forests Could Help Put a Brake on 
        <br>
        Global Warming</h1>
      <p>What if we stopped cutting down forests to produce palm      oil and cattle? What if we grew new forests on vacant     city lots, old industrial buildings — even golf courses?</p>
      <p>For the first time, scientists have sought to quantify this thought experiment. How many trees could be planted on every available parcel of land on Earth, where they could go, and what impact could that have on our survival?</p>

        <h1>A Heat Wave Bakes Europe, 
          <br>
          Where Air-Conditioning Is Scarce</h1>
        <p>LONDON — Never in recorded history has Paris been hotter than it was on Thursday, when the temperature neared 110 degrees. The same was true of Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, as a dangerous heat wave scorched Western Europe.</p>

        <p>Parisians could be seen plunging fully clothed into the fountains of the Trocadéro, Viennese cooled themselves in municipal misters, and Amsterdamers dangled their feet in a repurposed kiddie pool at a cafe. But here is what is far less likely to be seen: air-conditioners.</p>

        <h1>Jay Inslee: Climate Change Is a Winning Campaign Issue — 
          <br>
          and President Trump Knows It</h1>
        <p>I’ve heard it my whole career, from pundits, special interests and even political consultants: Just shut up about climate change if you want to be elected. They set up a false dichotomy between the economy and the environment, saying you can’t fight for good jobs and for clean air.</p>
        <p>That was bad advice then, and it’s even worse advice now. There is a change happening: Americans really feel climate change in their daily lives — and they are demanding leadership from their politicians like never before.</p>
